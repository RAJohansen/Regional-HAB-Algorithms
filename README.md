# Regional-HAB-Algorithms
Repository housing the scripts, data, results for the Regional Harmful Algal Blooms (HABS) Algorithm project and manuscript.

## Google Earth Engine (GEE) Scripts
The partial javascript code used to extract Sentinel-2 imagery via GEE can be found in the file "GEE_Sample_Script.txt"

## R scripts
All scripts can be found in the "Scripts2" folder
Functions utilized within this workflow inclued the following packages:\
[Tidyverse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse)\
[Waterquality](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=waterquality)\
[Caret](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caret)

## Data 
The full in situ and in vivo water quality dataset is availalble in the file "Nationwide_HAB_Baseline_Data.csv"
The aggregated coincident datasets used in the final analyses can be found in the Data "folder" for each of the temporal windows.

## Results
The Results2 folder contains a series of algorithm performances and error metrics for the regional (HUC-2), methodological, and nationwide approaches.

## Manuscript
Please see [A Broadscale Assessment of Sentinel-2 Imagery and the Google Earth Engine for the Nationwide Mapping of Chlorophyll a](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/5/2090) for full published results.
